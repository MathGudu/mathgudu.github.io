Infinity is a concept that has challenged me for most of my math journey. I still struggle trying to get intuition about it. At its core, infinity represents something without bounds or limits, often thought of as "endless" or "forever." The mathematician Georg Cantor said, "The fear of infinity is a form of myopia that destroys the possibility of seeing the actual infinite, even though it in its highest form has created and sustains us, and in its secondary transfinite forms occurs all around us and even inhabits our minds." If we break that down, Cantor essentually suggests that fearing infinity-viewing it as some bizzare or declining its exploration is a shortsighted viewpoiont that limits the intellectual growth of our minds. Cantor saw that infinity isn't just some abstract idea or concept, but a fundamental aspect of our reality. 

If you had asked middle school me what infinity means or represents, I probably would have said, "Something that doesn’t end—like the stars in the sky or the horizon when you’re looking out at the sea from a boat." Back then, infinity felt more like a poetic idea than something concrete. It wasn’t until university that I began to develop a deeper and more precise understanding of what infinity truly represents. I thought calculus would help clarify it, but instead, infinity became more of a tool than anything else. 

Consider the expression $$ \frac{1}{x} $$. If we let $$ x \to \infty $$, meaning we take the limit of $$ x $$ as it grows infinitely large, the value of $$ \frac{1}{x} $$ approaches zero. This is written as $$ \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0 $$. Calculus uses this kind of reasoning often, treating infinity as a way to describe behavior rather than something tangible. My understanding of infinity didn’t really evolve further until I took an elementary proofs course. That’s when I realized that, given some basic axioms and definitions, there are actually different sizes of infinity—an idea that really shook me. 

In set theory, Georg Cantor showed that some infinities are actually "bigger" than others. He once said, "The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom," and his work on infinite sets really brought that idea to life. For example, the set of natural numbers $$ \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} $$ is infinite, but so is the set of real numbers $$ \mathbb{R} $$, which includes all the rational numbers, irrational numbers, and everything in between. Cantor's famous "diagonal argument" $$ which we  will look at $$ proved that you can't pair up the real numbers one-to-one with the natural numbers. In other words, $$ \text{size}(\mathbb{R}) > \text{size}(\mathbb{N}) $$. This discovery is where we get the idea of "countable" versus "uncountable" infinities, which totally changes how you think about what infinity means, but this will take some work, we need to know what "one-to-one" means, "coutable" vs "uncoutable", and many more concepts. 


Firslt, let's try and buiild some intuition around the concept of different infinities, consider the following functions:  
$$
f(x) = x, \quad g(x) = x^2, \quad p(x) = e^x.
$$
These functions exhibit three distinct types of growth: **linear**, **quadratic**, and **exponential**, respectively. Plotting these functions can provide a visualization of their behavior as $$ x $$ increases:

![Growth of Functions](/posts/2024/11/infinity-intuition/images/infinity_post/function_growth.gif)

As $$ x \to 10 $$, we observe the following:  
- The linear growth of $$ f(x) $$ is steady and moderate.  
- The quadratic growth of $$ g(x) $$ accelerates faster than linear growth but is still slower compared to exponential growth.  
- The exponential growth of $$ p(x) $$ dominates, increasing far more rapidly than both $$ f(x) $$ and $$ g(x) $$.  

This demonstrates that as $$ x \to \infty $$, $$ p(x) $$ grows significantly faster than $$ g(x) $$, which in turn grows faster than $$ f(x) $$. With this, we can think of these rates of growth as reflecting "sizes" of infinities: the infinity represented by $$ p(x) $$ is, in some sense, "larger" than the infinities of $$ g(x) $$ or $$ f(x) $$. Now, we can make this a bit more formal. 

### What is a Function (or Map)?

A **function** or **map** describes a relationship between two spaces (usually we say sets). A space here represents a set of "things." For instance, when you switch a load of laundry, you act as a function:  
- The **washer** represents one space, and the **dryer** represents another space.  
- You "map" clothing from the washer to the dryer.

Formally, a function $$ f $$ is defined as:
$$
f: \text{space}_A \to \text{space}_B,
$$
where $$ f $$ is a subset of the $$ \text{space}_A \times \text{space}_B $$, i.e.,  
$$
f \subseteq \text{space}_A \times \text{space}_B.
$$

A function satisfies two key properties: 
1. **[Existence](/posts/2024/11/infinity-intuition/images/infinity_post/existence.md)**:    
   For every object $$ a \in \text{space}_A $$, there exists an object $$ b \in \text{space}_B $$ such that $$ (a, b) \in f $$.  

2. **[Uniqueness](/posts/2024/11/infinity-intuition/images/infinity_post/uniqueness.md)**:  
   For every $$ a \in \text{space}_A $$, if $$ b, b' \in \text{space}_B $$ and $$ (a, b) \in f $$ and $$ (a, b') \in f $$, then $$ b = b' $$.  

This means that each element in $$ \text{space}_A $$ is associated with exactly one element in $$ \text{space}_B $$.
